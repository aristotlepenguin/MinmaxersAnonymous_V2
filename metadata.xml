    <description>This is a mod for people who like to play 30 minute runs for 10 hours. The 10 items and 2 characters in this pack reward, enable, or encourage shameless game-breakery while not trivializing what it takes to get into that state. 

There's an item that transforms pickups into something else when you're full. One item doubles your damage if you crash the game with it. There's a D6 variant that forces you do complex algebra and time your reroll lest you turn your item into The Poop. 

Don't worry, we can go stupider. There's a score attack challenge with a unique scoring system, and the end trophy disappears if you don't hit a million. Or a billion, depending on your settings.</description>
